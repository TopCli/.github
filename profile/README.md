## 👋 Welcome visitor

TopCli is an organization that aims to create open-source Node.js CLI packages. Our goal is to bring developers together with the common goal of building quality packages that will be actively maintained. Any initiative or idea is welcome as long as it contributes to the improvement of the CLI experience in Node.js.

We also want to bring security back to the forefront because it is often forgotten or underestimated by package designers.

> 👀 The people behind the project are also behind the [NodeSecure](https://github.com/NodeSecure) project.
